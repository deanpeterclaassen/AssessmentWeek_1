// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirments = "In this step client requiremnts are understood, developmental risks are identified, and the method of quality assurance is decided. "
const design = "Once planning and analysis of requirments has completed delevopers lay out the vision and details of the final product."
const implementation = "IN this step developers begin to code based upon the design and requirements. Developers cycle through the requients until they have met and coded for each one."
const testingAndIntergration = "This is last step completed prior to the software bing delivered. Developers and testers run the the code to detect defects and ensure that every aspect and application of the code runs as expected. If a defect is found it is corrected and the cycle completes until the requiremnets are met and there are no longer any defects."
const maintain = "This is the step in which once the software has been delivered and is being used, any issues that arise are sent to the developers and they fix the issues. This maintians the structure of the software as it is being used."
